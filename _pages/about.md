I am a science all-rounder, passionate about science literacy and communication.  With a focus on chemistry and chemical engineering, I am pursuing a doctoral degree in renewable energy with the [Fuels and Energy Technology Institute](http://energy.curtin.edu.au/) at Curtin University, looking at biomass valorisation for transport fuels and as precursors of green plastics and other key molecules that drive the world economy.

<!-- I undertake a teaching role -  -->

To foster interest in the chemical sciences amongst my peers and the next generation of students, I join the [American Chemical Society's Australian Student Chapter](https://www.acs.org/education/students/college/studentaffiliates.html#:~:text=ACS%20Student%20Chapters%20ACS%20student%20chapters%20are%20organizations,college%20experience%20and%20prepare%20them%20for%20successful%20careers.) as a Committee member to promote chemical science awareness and foster the links between industry, academia and prospective students.

I have explored my interest in science communication by partnering with high schools around Western Australia through [CSIRO's STEM Professionals program](https://www.csiro.au/en/Education/Programs/STEM-Professionals-in-Schools), where we design experiments to help students understand fundamental science concepts, preparing the next generation for the challenges of tomorrow.

I am also passionate about technology and its incorporation into science and other sectors. To this end, I enrolled into the [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador Program](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/en-US/) to enhance my digital literacy and community building skills. As a result, I have incorporated computational chemistry into my research work, and I am currently looking to understand and incorporate Machine Learning approaches in the near future.  As an ambassador, I also take part in various Microsoft Student Initiatives, with the end of goal of enhancing science research through technology.
